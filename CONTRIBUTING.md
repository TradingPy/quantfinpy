Contributing to quantfinpy

All contributions are welcome as well as raising new issues.

Standards for pull requests
============================

- Create a branch with your changes.
- Run tox locally to assert that code is formatted, typed, documented and tests are passing.
- Add a few tests to cover new code.
- Create pull request with a summary of the changes, i.e. a few bullet points are enough.

Goals of the pull requests are mostly to ensure that changes:

- follow regular python standards and 
- can be understood + used by the wider community.
