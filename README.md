# quantfinpy

Quantitative finance in python.

## Context

This project is still in the early development phase and is mostly an educational experience for now.

## Credits

Most of the initial design and logic is derived from : Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives (10th Edition) by John C. Hull

## Testing

As the project is still in its early development phase, the testing doesn't cover most of the edge cases and some of the underlying interfaces.
As the project becomes more mature and the interfaces become more stable, more tests will be added.
